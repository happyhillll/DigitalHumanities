       "\"gin of Species.\\n\\nIntroduction.\\n\\nWhen on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with certain facts in the\\ndistribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the present to the\\npast inhabitants of that continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of\\nspecies--that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest philosophers. On\\nmy return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhaps be made out on this\\nquestion by patiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have\\nany bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on the subject, and drew up\\nsome short notes; these I enlarged in 1844 into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to\\nme probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the same object. I hope\\nthat I may be excused for entering on these personal details, as I give them to show that I have not\\nbeen hasty in coming to a decision.\\n\\nMy work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more years to complete it, and\\nas my health is far from strong, I have been urged to publish this Abstract. I have more especially\\nbeen induced to do this, as Mr. Wallace, who is now studying the natural history of the Malay\\narchipelago, has arrived at almost exactly the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of\\nspecies. Last year he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward it to\\nSir Charles Lyell, who sent it to the Linnean Society, and it is published in the third volume of the\\nJournal of that Society. Sir C. Lyell and Dr. Hooker, who both knew of my work--the latter having\\nread my sketch of 1844--honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish, with Mr. Wallace's\\nexcellent memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts.\\n\\nThis Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot here give references\\nand authorities for my several statements; and I must trust to the reader reposing some confidence\\nin my accuracy. No doubt errors will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in\\ntrusting to good authorities alone. I can here give only the general conclusions at which I have\\narrived, with a few facts in illustration, but which, I hope, in most cases will suffice. No one can\\nfeel more sensible than I do of the necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts, with\\nreferences, on which my conclusions have been grounded; and I hope in a future work to do this.\\nFor I am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which facts cannot\\nbe adduced, often apparently leading to conclusions directly opposite to those at which I have\\narrived. A fair result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments\\non both sides of each question; and this cannot possibly be here done.\\n\\nI much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of acknowledging the\\ngenerous assistance which I have received from very many naturalists, some of them personally\\nunknown to me. I cannot, however, let this opportunity pass without expressing my deep\\nobligations to Dr. Hooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me in every possible way by his\\nlarge stores of knowledge and his excellent judgment.\\n\\nIn considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a naturalist, reflecting on the\\nmutual affinities of organic beings, on their embryological relations, their geographical distribution,\\n\\x0c\""
